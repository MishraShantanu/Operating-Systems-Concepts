Features of MLFQ scheduling:
       Every process is assigned with High priority at the start of process, once its schulded for one time its priority is reduced to medium 
       later when the process is scheduled m number of times then its moved to low priority. After a certain schulded (moveup) all the process priority 
       is set as High. 
      

Features of waitstat system call:
        It is used to eveluate the system performance.It wait for the child process to complete same as the regular wait sys call and return pid. In addition this sys call 
        also return the Turn around time and run time of the process. 
    
Features of test.c a user program:
        1. It forks the process 45 times and perform computation for each for based upon the args pass (K,L,M,N)
       
	2. For the 1st 15 processes it performs computation usig K and L 
           for next 15 it uses K and M 
           and for last 15 it uses K and N. 
	
        3. After forking all the 45 processes parent wait for child processes to complete their job using waitstat (syscall)
	   Once a child exit its workflow parent recives its pid, turn arround time and run time
        
        4. Main appends the turn around time and run time for each group process together and then at the end it print outs the 
           result of turn around time and run time as per the group. 

		
performance  comparison for new MLFQ scheduling with old scheduling in Xv6
     
    * Old scheduling in Xv6 run result
		$ test 50000 50000 50000 50000
		Group 1 where K = 50000 & L = 50000 Turn Around Time: 13727, Run Time: 943
		Group 2 where K = 50000 & M = 50000 Turn Around Time: 13748, Run Time: 945
		Group 3 where K = 50000 & N = 50000 Turn Around Time: 13688, Run Time: 940
   
    * New MLFQ scheduling in Xv6 run result
                $ test 50000 50000 50000 50000
		Group 1 where K = 50000 & L = 50000 Turn Around Time: 4122, Run Time: 945
		Group 2 where K = 50000 & M = 50000 Turn Around Time: 8175, Run Time: 944
		Group 3 where K = 50000 & N = 50000 Turn Around Time: 12270, Run Time: 937
    It can be clearly seen that the new MLFQ scheduler has imporved the the total turn around time by 59.68%
    Changing the moveup and mtimes values further can also help to reduce the turn around time. But the run time 
    almost remains the same. 
        
How to run:

    1. call make qemu 
    2. once the shell is ready call test with 4 argument 
        example. test 5000 3000 2000 1000
        Sample output 
        $ test 5000 3000 2000 1000
	Group 1 where K = 5000 & L = 3000 Turn Around Time: 13, Run Time: 18
	Group 2 where K = 5000 & M = 2000 Turn Around Time: 33, Run Time: 20
	Group 3 where K = 5000 & N = 1000 Turn Around Time: 45, Run Time: 15
        
 
     

Known bugs:
	-NA


Known limitations:
      User needs to pass 4 arguments every time to run the program 


Changes made in xv6-riscv


        kernel/defs.h
          Added int             waitstat(uint64,uint64,uint64);
        
 	kernel/proc.c
	   added a global variable to keep track of total number schulded runs, 
           used to perform priority refresh when moveup is equal to schedulerCounter.
				uint64 schedulerCounter = 0;
        kernel/proc.c:allocproc
            added   acquire(&tickslock);
    		    p->created = ticks;
    		    release(&tickslock);
                    p->runtime = 0;
		   
 		    p->priority = HIGH;
                    p->running = 0;

        kernel/proc.c:exit
          added    acquire(&tickslock);
  		   p->ended = ticks;
                   release(&tickslock);

        kernel/proc.c:scheduler
          updated the scheduler with MLFQ scheduling 

        kernel/proc.c
	  added syscall waitstat

        kernel/proc.h 
          added    int created;                //process creation timestamp 
 		   int ended;                  //process end timestamp 
                   int runtime;                //total process run time
                   enum procpriority priority;  // Priority of the process  
                   int running;                 // number of times a process has been schedule
       		   enum procpriority {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW};

        kernel/syscall.c
          added       extern uint64 sys_waitstat(void);
	             [SYS_waitstat] sys_waitstat,

        kernel/syscall.h
          Added       #define SYS_waitstat 22

        kernel/sysproc.c 
            Added uint64 sys_waitstat(void)
                 which return waitstat(p,turnaroundTime,runningTime);



        user/test.c
            added user program to test the new sys call

        user/user.h
            added int waitstat(int* , int * , int* );


        user/usys.pl
           added entry("waitstat");

        Makefile 
		added /_test under UPROGS
